# 🚨 CRITICAL: GPT-4o-mini Scorecard Scanning Results

## The Bottom Line
**GPT-4o-mini is NOT ready for production scorecard scanning.** Period.

## Key Numbers That Matter
- **Best accuracy achieved:** 64.3% (medium effort)
- **Worst latency:** 4.5 minutes per scan (high effort)  
- **Complete failures:** 2 out of 18 tests
- **Cost efficiency winner:** Low effort (but still only 61% accurate)

## What This Means for Business

### ❌ Cannot Ship This Feature
1. **User trust killer:** 61-64% accuracy means users will lose confidence quickly
2. **Support nightmare:** Manual corrections needed for 35-40% of scans
3. **Cost prohibitive:** High reasoning effort costs too much for minimal gain
4. **Reliability issues:** Complete system failures unacceptable

### 🚨 Immediate Action Required
**Recommendation: HALT scorecard AI development immediately**

### 🔄 Alternative Strategies
1. **Manual-first approach:** Excel at manual entry UX instead
2. **Wait for better models:** GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 might perform better
3. **Hybrid solution:** OCR + human validation
4. **Premium only:** Use expensive but accurate models for paid tiers

## Technical Insights
- **Low reasoning effort = best ROI:** 61% accuracy at 2.6k tokens vs 63% at 19k tokens
- **Higher reasoning often worse:** Counterintuitive degradation in performance
- **Confidence scores useless:** 61-64% error rate means AI doesn't know when it's wrong
- **Complete parsing failures:** Some scorecards break the AI entirely

## Next Steps
1. **Stop AI scorecard development**
2. **Focus on manual entry excellence** 
3. **Test GPT-4o when budget allows**
4. **Consider this a learning opportunity, not a failure**

The testing framework worked perfectly and should be used for future AI model evaluation.

**Tested:** 6 scorecards, 3 reasoning levels, 18 total tests  
**Conclusion:** Not production ready - need alternative approach
